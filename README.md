The Sacrifice Mirror

The Sacrifice Mirror is a poetic, cinematic desktop application that gently asks users about a recent personal sacrifice. It then uses their exact responses to generate a completely **unique, emotionally intelligent poem** just for them â€” line by line.

This app is designed to **soothe, reflect, and inspire**. It features a sophisticated GUI, soft piano background music, and the ability to export your custom poem to PDF.
